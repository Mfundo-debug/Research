ID: PCMABA - HIV/AIDS Educators study: Study of the determinants of demand and supply of educators based in public educational institutions and FET colleges


HSRC Processing Standards
---------------------------------
The data were processed according to a thorough and comprehensive series 
of checks to ensure the quality of the data and documentation. 
After quality control of data capturing, a series of programs were executed to 
determine errors regarding inconsistencies in the data. Logical checks were performed 
to ensure that nominal (categorical) variables had values within the range defined. 
The majority of errors were corrected. Consistency checks were done on the extent to which 
skip patterns were followed during data collection. 

Checks were made that all variables had comprehensible variable labels and all 
nominal (categorical) variables had comprehensible value labels. Lastly, any 
data or documentation that breached confidentiality rules were altered or 
suppressed to preserve anonymity.
